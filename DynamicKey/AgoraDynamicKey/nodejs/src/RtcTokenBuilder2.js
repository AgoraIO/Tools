     * A user can have multiple privileges. Each privilege is valid for a maximum of 24 hours.
     * The SDK triggers the onTokenPrivilegeWillExpire and onRequestToken callbacks when the token is about to expire
     * or has expired. The callbacks do not report the specific privilege affected, and you need to maintain
     * the respective timestamp for each privilege in your app logic. After receiving the callback, you need
